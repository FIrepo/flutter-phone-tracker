This a simple flutter/node 3 part project.

    1. The client app get's the user's current location and sends it to the server.
    2. The master app calls the server and shows the specific user's current location on a map.
    3. The server is responsible for authentication as well as the logging of locations.

Make sure to set your google maps key here:
    1. phone_tracker_master/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift
    2. phone_tracker_master/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

Make sure to set your server's ip address at:
    1. phone_tracker_master/lib/global.dart
    2. phone_tracker_client/lib/global.dart

I'd appreciate it if you could show your support by buying me some coffee. Thank you :)
